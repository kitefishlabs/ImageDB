This is the code from an installation project I did at Squeaky Wheel in Buffalo, NY, titled Overgrowth. It was produced as part of a Regional Artist Access Residency (RAAR).

I am posting this on GitHub (2/13) with the hope that someone finds it useful some day. I plan to come back to this project at some point and develop further.

It was made with OpenFrameworks 0072

TO DO:
