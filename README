This is the code from an installation project I did at Squeaky Wheel in Buffalo, NY, titled Overgrowth. It was produced as part of a Regional Artist Access Residency (RAAR).

I am posting this on GitHub (2/13) with the hope that someone finds it useful some day. I plan to come back to this project at some point and develop further.

It was made with OpenFrameworks 0072.

An introductory tutorial and more docs will be available by summer 2013.

TO DO:

documentation
clean up code
make better
